Before Normalization
mvar28 - can be used as 0/1 for ordering - no. of days missed for payment
mvar14 - annual income - very very large
mvar3 maybe = mvar4 + mvar5
mvar17 almost= mvar18, mvar18<=mvar17 ::::: similarly mvar19 and mvar20


After Normalization
mvar8 >= mvar7
mvar29 <= mvar25
mvar26, mvar27, mvar29 are related
